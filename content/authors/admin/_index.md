I founded the Tabbre Project because I believe the only viable solution to the climate crisis is to make renewable energy cheaper and more abundant than fossil fuels.
Cheap, plentiful, reliable renewable energy is essential for a sustainable, prosperous future.
My career of over 40 years working in Europe, North America and the UK that included senior business, engineering and IT roles in industries such as blockchain, banking, energy, automotive manufacturing, utilities and central government, has equipped me with the skills and knowledge needed to deliver the Tabbre Project.
