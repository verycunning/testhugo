# **GDP growth rate between now and 2050** {#gdp-growth-rate-between-now-and-2050}

Based on the search results, the estimated world GDP growth rate between now and 2050 is projected to be around 2.5% annually on average. Specifically:

1. Capital Economics forecasts long-term global GDP growth of 2.5% per annum, which would result in the world economy being about twice as large by 2050 compared to last year\[5\].  
2. The IMF's World Economic Outlook projects global growth to continue at 3.2% in 2024 and 2025, the same pace as in 2023\. However, their forecast for global growth five years from now is lower at 3.1%, which they note is the lowest in decades\[2\].  
3. The UN's World Economic Situation and Prospects report for 2024 forecasts a deceleration in global GDP growth, from an estimated 2.7% in 2023 to 2.4% in 2024, indicating a continuation of sluggish growth trends\[1\].  
4. PwC's Global Economy Watch projections show global GDP growth (at market exchange rates) declining slightly from 2.7% in 2024 to 2.6% in 2025, and then averaging 2.5% for 2026-2029\[3\].

While there are slight variations in the projections, the overall consensus points to a global GDP growth rate of around 2.5% annually between now and 2050, which is lower than the historical average of 3.7% between 2000 and 2019\[5\].

# **Fossil fuel consumption between now and 2050** {#fossil-fuel-consumption-between-now-and-2050}

Based on the search results, the expected rate of growth of fossil fuel consumption between now and 2050 is projected to be low or even negative, with significant variations across different fossil fuels and sectors. Here are the key points:

1. Overall fossil fuel demand is likely to flatten or decline through mid-century\[1\]. The share of fossil fuels in global energy consumption is expected to decrease substantially, potentially halving to reach 41% by 2050\[3\].  
2. Natural gas demand is projected to remain strong or even increase:  
   * It could rise as much as 47% by 2050\[1\].  
   * The EIA projects increased consumption of natural gas through 2050, particularly in the industrial sector of non-OECD countries\[2\].  
3. Oil consumption trends vary by sector:  
   * Oil use in on-road transportation is likely to fall by 50% or more by mid-century\[1\].  
   * However, industrial use of petroleum liquids as feedstock is expected to grow, especially in the chemicals industry\[2\].  
4. Coal consumption is projected to decrease significantly:  
   * Coal-powered electricity generation is expected to fall by more than half by 2050 from today's levels\[1\].  
   * However, industrial coal use may expand in non-OECD countries\[2\].  
5. In the most optimistic scenario for emissions reduction (the "Rupture" scenario), fossil fuels would only meet 40% of the world's primary energy demand in 2050\[4\].  
6. The IEA's Net Zero by 2050 scenario envisions fossil fuels falling from almost four-fifths of total energy supply today to slightly over one-fifth by 2050\[5\].

It's important to note that these projections vary depending on the scenario and assumptions used, particularly regarding policy changes and technological advancements in clean energy alternatives.

# **Total global energy consumption between now and 2050** {#total-global-energy-consumption-between-now-and-2050}

Based on the search results, the expected rate of growth of total global energy consumption between now and 2050 varies depending on the scenario, but generally shows moderate growth. Here are the key points:

1. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects that global energy consumption will increase nearly 50% over the next 30 years, which translates to an average annual growth rate of about 1.4%\[1\].  
2. ExxonMobil's Global Outlook forecasts a 15% increase in energy use by 2050, which equates to an average annual growth rate of approximately 0.5%\[2\].  
3. TotalEnergies presents multiple scenarios:  
   * The "Current Course & Speed" scenario forecasts a 0.7% per year increase in total primary energy demand\[3\].  
   * The "Rupture" scenario, which assumes more aggressive energy efficiency measures, projects a 0.1% per year increase in total primary energy demand\[3\].  
4. The International Energy Agency's (IEA) Net Zero by 2050 scenario envisions global energy demand in 2050 being around 8% smaller than today, despite serving an economy more than twice as big and a population with 2 billion more people\[4\]. This implies a slight decrease in energy consumption over the period.

The variations in these projections stem from different assumptions about factors such as economic growth, population increase, energy efficiency improvements, and the pace of transition to renewable energy sources. Overall, the consensus seems to be that global energy consumption will grow, but at a slower rate than in previous decades, with some optimistic scenarios even projecting a slight decrease.
